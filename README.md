## Introduction

This repository is the third project of the master's degree in AI Engineering with [Profession AI](https://profession.ai), all the credits for the requests and idea go to this team. 

VisionTech Solutions aims to develop an automatic image recognition system to distinguish between vehicles and animals, with the aim of optimizing wildlife monitoring operations in urban areas, avoiding road accidents and protecting both animals and vehicles. VisionTech Solutions works with municipal administrations to implement a real-time monitoring system in cities, using cameras installed along the roads to identify and classify vehicles and animals. This system will help prevent road accidents caused by the sudden crossing of animals, warning drivers through electronic road signs.

Benefits:
- Process Automation
- Increased Accuracy
- Operational Efficiency
- Multiple Applications

Project steps and information:
* Dataset
    - Use of the CIFAR dataset, containing thousands of images labeled in various categories, including vehicles and animals.
* Algorithm
    - Implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image analysis and classification.
* Output:
    - The system will correctly classify each image as a vehicle or an animal.
* Model Evaluation:
    - Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified images compared to the total.
    - Precision: Quality of positive predictions, indicating the proportion of correctly identified images.
* Results Analysis:
    - Identification of any error patterns.
    - Evaluation of the categories of images systematically confused.
    - Examination of the erroneous images and reflection on possible improvements to the model.

## Dataset
For this project, I need to use [CIFAR dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10). The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

The label classes in the dataset are:
1. airplane 
2. automobile 
3. bird 
4. cat 
5. deer 
6. dog 
7. frog 
8. horse 
9. ship 
10. truck
