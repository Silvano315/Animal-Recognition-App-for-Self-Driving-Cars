# Animal-Recognition-for-Self-Driving-Cars
This is the fifth project of AI Engineering Master. It aims to develop an automatic image recognition system to distinguish between vehicles and animals. I need to implement convolutional neural network (CNN) for image analysis and classification in a binary problem (vehicle or animal).  My extra goal is to build a DL real-time application.
